# RNA-Concentration-Forecast
I use Nanodrop-measured RNA concentrations to predict levels via various models:  Naive Model: Baseline. Dense Models: Model 1: Window 3, Horizon 1. Model 2: Window 5, Horizon 1. Model 3: Window 7, Horizon 3. Conv1D Model: Captures patterns. These models forecast RNA concentrations from Nanodrop data.
